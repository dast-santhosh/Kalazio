# Kalazio Design Guidelines – Desh ka Market

## Design Philosophy

**Core Concept**: A living, breathing digital reimagination of India's artistic spirit—a highly animated cultural experience that unites artisans, performers, and cultural creators worldwide. Every element should tell a story and immerse users in India's rhythm, color, and heritage.

**Experience Tone**: Like walking through a grand cultural exhibition where art, learning, and storytelling blend into one continuous animated journey. Think ArtStation × Coursera × Indian Museum × Netflix, but animated with the soul of India.

## Color Palette (Exact Values - Non-Negotiable)

- **Teal**: #67C7BD
- **Royal Purple**: #6C2A84
- **Rani Pink**: #E0318E
- **Saffron Orange**: #E2791F
- **Mustard Gold**: #EEC056

These five tones represent joy, devotion, creativity, prosperity, and wisdom. Use them as living gradients, textured overlays, and woven patterns reminiscent of Indian handlooms and murals—not flat swatches.

## Typography

- Modern sans-serifs for body text and clarity
- Indian-style type flourishes for headings (Devanagari-inspired scripts, Tamil-style accents, calligraphic ligatures)
- Drop caps with cultural motifs
- Kinetic text with scroll-triggered reveals

## Layout & Visual Elements

**No Minimalism**: Thrive in vibrance, rhythm, and ornamentation
- No sharp edges—every card, section, or image frame must have curvature, flow, and softness
- Integrate mandala geometry, temple arches, textile motifs, and henna-inspired outlines subtly across the interface
- Light gradients and shadows for depth and craftsmanship
- Layered parallax effects throughout

## Animation & Motion Strategy

**Philosophy**: Motion as narrative—scrolls should reveal, unfold, bloom, or flow, never simply switch

**Implementation**:
- Framer Motion for scroll-triggered storytelling
- Lottie animations for complex cultural motifs
- Layered parallax effects
- Kinetic text reveals
- Fading light transitions
- Rotational object reveals
- Smooth transitions like fabric folds or brush strokes

**Rhythm**: Alternate between Celebration (vibrant motion, music, color), Stillness (minimal transitions, emotional focus), and Revelation (smooth scrolls to deeper stories)

**Audio**: Optional background soundscape—soft tanpura hum, temple bells, veena, mridangam, or flute motifs fading with scroll (toggle button)
